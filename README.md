# 🐷 Dead & Tattooed

Dead & Tattooed is an e-commerce web app built for a tattoo artist who sells preserved tattoo art pieces.  
Each piece is a one-of-a-kind specimen — tattooed pig’s feet sealed in jars and sold as collectible artwork.  
The goal is to move away from Etsy’s high fees and create a standalone, secure storefront with full creative control.
