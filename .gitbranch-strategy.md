# Git Branch Strategy

## Branch Overview

- **`main`**: Production branch with the simple landing page (Instagram redirect)
  - This branch should remain stable and only be updated when the shopping cart is ready to go live
  - Protected: Only merge from `dev` when features are complete and tested

- **`dev`**: Development branch for all active work
  - All Linear tickets should be worked on in this branch
  - This is where all shopping cart features, auth, and other development happens
  - When shopping cart is ready, merge `dev` → `main`

## Workflow

1. **For new features/tickets:**
   - Work directly on `dev` branch
   - Create feature branches from `dev` if needed: `git checkout -b feature/ticket-name`
   - Merge feature branches back to `dev` when complete

2. **When ready to deploy:**
   - Ensure all tests pass on `dev`
   - Merge `dev` → `main`: `git checkout main && git merge dev`
   - Deploy `main` branch

3. **To start working:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   ```

## Current Status

- `main`: Simple landing page (Instagram redirect) - **DO NOT MODIFY**
- `dev`: Active development branch with auth, shopping cart work, etc.
